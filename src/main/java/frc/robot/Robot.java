/**
 * This is the main robot class. WPILib calls different methods here depending
 * on what mode the robot is in (disabled, autonomous, teleop, test).
 *
 * LoggedRobot is a drop-in replacement for TimedRobot that adds AdvantageKit
 * log replay support. It still calls our "periodic" methods every 20 milliseconds
 * (50 times per second). That's the robot's heartbeat -- every 20ms it checks
 * for new joystick input, updates motors, reads sensors, etc.
 *
 * The flow is:
 *   1. Robot boots up -> constructor runs -> sets up logging -> creates RobotContainer
 *   2. Every 20ms -> robotPeriodic() runs the CommandScheduler
 *   3. When a mode starts (auto, teleop, etc.) -> the corresponding Init method runs
 *   4. While in that mode -> the corresponding Periodic method runs every 20ms
 *
 * You usually don't need to add much code here. Most of the robot logic lives in
 * RobotContainer (button bindings), subsystems (hardware control), and commands
 * (actions the robot performs).
