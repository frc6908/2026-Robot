 * Each inner class groups related constants together (controller stuff, intake stuff,

 *
 * THIS IS THE FIRST FILE TO LOOK AT when you want to change robot behavior.
 * Most tweaks (speed, sensitivity, motor IDs, PID tuning) happen here.

 * WANT TO CHANGE robot speed? Look in DrivetrainConstants.
 * WANT TO CHANGE controller sensitivity? Look in OperatorConstants.
 * WANT TO CHANGE a motor port? Look in the appropriate mechanism class (IntakeConstants, etc.).
