/**
 * The default teleop driving command -- this is what runs whenever the driver is
 * using the joysticks to control the robot.
 *
 * This command reads joystick inputs and converts them into swerve drive commands.
 * It applies several processing steps to make driving feel smooth and controllable:
 *
 *   1. DEADBANDS: Small joystick movements (within the deadband zone) are treated as
 *      zero. This prevents the robot from drifting when the driver's thumbs aren't
 *      perfectly centered on the sticks.
 *
 *   2. SMOOTH ACCELERATION: Limits how quickly the speed can change. Instead of
 *      jumping from 0 to max speed instantly (which would jerk the robot), the speed
 *      ramps up smoothly. Like the difference between slamming the gas pedal vs.
 *      gradually pressing it.
 *
 *   3. SPEED SLIDER: The left trigger acts as a "slow-down" control. Pulling it reduces
 *      ALL movement speeds proportionally. Fully pulled = 80% speed reduction.
 *      This gives the driver fine control for precise alignment.
 *
 * This command never finishes on its own (isFinished returns false) -- it runs
 * continuously as the drivetrain's default command until another command takes over.
 *
 * WANT TO CHANGE driving feel? Adjust deadbands in OperatorConstants, or max speeds
 * in DrivetrainConstants.
 * WANT TO CHANGE the slider range? Modify the sliderVal cap (currently 0.8 = 80% max reduction).
